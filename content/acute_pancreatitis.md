## Pathphysiology + Etiology
=
### Pathophysiology
- Duct and acinar indirect/direct injury
  - impaired secretion
    - premature activation of digestive enzymes (proteases)
      - autodigestion and acute inflammation
=
### Most Common
- Biliary Disease
  - **stones (40%)**
  - sludge
- **Alcohol (30%)**
- ERCP (5%)
=
### Less Common
- *Medications (5%)*
  - Furosemide
  - Didanosine
  - Asparaginase
  - Mesalamine
  - Thiazides
  - 6-Mercaptopurine/azathioprine
  - Sulfasalazine
  - Estrogen
- **Hypertriglyceridemia (2-5%)**
- Hypercalcemia
=
#### Hypertriglyceridemia induced Pancreatitis
- up to 56 percent of pancreatitis cases during pregnancy
- the risk of acute pancreatitis increases progressively with serum triglyceride levels over 500 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L), with the risk increasing markedly with levels over 1000 mg/dL
=
### Rare
- infectious
- ischemia
- traumatic
- neoplasia
- Celiac diseases
---
## Clinical Features + Diagnosis
=
### Presentation
- **Epigastric or LUQ pain (90%)**
  - only HALF have radiating to the back
- **N/V (90%)**
- Dyspnea (severe patients, due to diaphragmatic inflammation)

*10% have atypical presentation WITHOUT pain and unexplained hypotension*
**eruptive xanthomas (in the setting of hypertriglyceridemia**


###### Time course
- Early phase (<1 wk)
  - possible SIRS + organ failure
- Late phase
  - local complications
  
**those with HTG-AP vs other etiologies have double the risk of ICU admission, SIRS and organ failure!**
=
### Diagnosis
- 2 of 3 criteria:
    1. classic abdominal pain
    2. lipase/amylase >3x upper normal limit
        - rises faster than amylase
    3. findings on imaging
        - U/S should be used to r/o biliary etiologies
        - CT only to investigate complications

**serum TG's should be measured ASAP as they rapidly start downtrending with fasting**
---
## Differential
=
### Differential
Generally, other sources of epigastric pain, can be distinguished with **contrast enhanced** CT
- Acute cholecystitis
- Perforated viscus
- SBO
- mesenteric ischemia
- Ruptured ectopic pregnancy
- AAA
---
## Management
---
## Initial
- Fluids
  - aggresive in first 24h
  - 20 ml/kg IV Bolus --> 3 ml/kg/hr
  - LR > NS
  - Goal: Decrease BUN and HCt
- Pain Mgmt (usually IV opiods)
- Anti-emetics

**antibiotics are not warranted in acute pancreatitis unless there is evidence of extrapancreatic infection, such as ascending cholangitis, bacteremia, urinary tract infection, or pneumonia. Use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with sterile pancreatic necrosis to prevent infected necrosis is not recommended.**
=
## Nutrition + Insulin + Heparin!
- Early enteral feeding is encouraged --> transition to PO as tolerated
- Enteral > TPN to decrease risk of infectious complications

In the case of hypertriglyceridemia --> insulin gtt (activates lipases) + **fibrates**
- in addition to restriction of fatty meals
- if recurrent pancreatitis with high triglycerides --> Antioxidant therapies (Selenium, beta carotene, vitamin C)

 - fibrates result in a 30% to 50% reduction in triglyceride level; these agents are indicated in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥500 mg/dL [5.65 mmol/L] and especially ≥1000 mg/dL [11.30 mmol/L]) to prevent acute pancreatitis. 
 - Icosapent ethyl or pharmacologic doses (4 g/d) of omega-3 fatty acid preparations are also effective at decreasing triglyceride levels. 
 **#MKSAP19**
- Heparin releases stored LPL from endothelial cells to lower TG's (usually given in combination with insulin)
  + *although preferably avoid this due to risk of hemmorhage and rebound HTG*

---
## Takeaways (taken from MKSAP19)
- Biliary disease (gallstones, biliary sludge, or microlithiasis) is the most common cause of acute pancreatitis.
- Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires two of three criteria:
  - (1) acute-onset upper abdominal pain
  - (2) serum lipase or amylase levels elevated at least three times the upper limit of normal
  - (3) characteristic findings on imaging
- Patients with acute pancreatitis should undergo transabdominal ultrasonography rather than CT for evaluation of biliary disease.
- Early and aggressive fluid resuscitation should be initiated in patients with acute pancreatitis.
- In mild acute pancreatitis, oral feedings can be started as soon as nausea and vomiting are controlled and clinical symptoms are alleviated; enteral feeding should begin within 72 hours if oral feeding is not tolerated.
- Pancreatic pseudocysts do not require drainage unless they cause significant symptoms or are infected, regardless of size.

**Patients with HTG-AP typically do worse than others**
