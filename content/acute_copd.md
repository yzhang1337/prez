---
## Background
----
"is defined as a disease state characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow obstruction" which includes
- emphysema
- chronic bronchitis
- small airway disease

caused by both environmental and genetic factors
----
### Etiology of Exacerbations
- Most cases are caused by respiratory **viral** infections (rhinovirus being most common)
- *bacterial* infections include  Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae
- Other triggers include:
     - drugs (beta-blockers)
     - environmental exposures (allergens, smoke, air pollution)
     - stress

----
### Prevention
- smoking cessation and pulmonary rehab
- proper inhaler technique
- routine immunizations
- Long term use of azithromycin or roflumilast in patients with frequent exacerbations

---
## Workup
----
### For Severe cases...
Patients who have COPD and respiratory distress or who are at risk of developing respiratory distress should be hospitalized and evaluated with:
- a chest radiograph
- electrocardiogram
- complete blood count
- basic metabolic panel
- oxygen saturation
- arterial blood gas

*sputum culture is not routinely used, rarely affects management*
---
## Clinical Decision Making
----
### Severity






----
### Ottawa COPD Risk Scale (OCRS)

---
## Management
----
### By Severity

- Mild: Short acting bronchodilators
- Moderate: Antibiotics, glucocorticoids
- Severe: Admit for further workup

Supplemental oxygenation,Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, mechnical ventilation as necesarry (to maintain O2 sat 88-92%)
