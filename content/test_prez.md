## The Basics

----

## Definition

*‘la bruxomanie’ was first introduced by Marie
Pietkiewicz in 1907* 

"repetitive masticatory muscle activity that is characterized
by clenching or grinding of the teeth and/or by bracing or thrusting of the mandible,
which is specified as either sleep bruxism or awake bruxism..."

**typically 1 Hz in frequency**
----
## How often does it happen?

- in adult populations, frequency is between 5.9 - 49.0%
    - *from 1966 to 2002 there was an increase from 5 to 22% in university aged adults*
- Awake Bruxism, Female > male tendency 
- elderly population is relatively free of bruxism


----
## Who are the grinders?

- depression
- generalized anxiety
- high stress
- drug-induced

---
# Drug-Induced Bruxism

----
# Which Drugs?

-  **3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy, MDMA)**
- Cocaine
- amphetamines
- SSRI's/SNRI's
    1. Fluoxetine + Sertraline
    2. Venlafaxine
- L-DOPA

----
# Out in the world...

- "meth mouth"
- Sex, drugs & rock 'n' roll
    - "gurning"
- tooth decay

----
# Working hypothesis

Serotonin x Dopamine

----
# Dopamine
- balance of motor output in PFC by maintaning inhibitory tone
- DA activity in the PFC is modulated by inhibitory 5-HT neurons (mesocortical tract and ventral tegmental area)

----
# 5-HT
- decreases DA activity at PFC
- trigeminal motor neurons are activated by 5-HT (and NE)

----
# All together now...

- Raphe Nucleus (5-HT neurons)
- VTA
- Mesocortical DA Tract
- PFC
- Trigeminal Nerve
- Masticatory Muscles

----
## Occam's Razor

Theoretically, a laundry list of other NT's are involved from CCK to Angiotensin to Substance P... 

---
# Tardive Dystonia
some other *face stuff...*

----
## Oral Maxilliofacial Nightmare

- painful orofacial-dystonia + sleep bruxism significantly increases risk for:
    1. chronic migraine
    2. episodic migraine
    3. episodic tension-type headaches

----
## Can bruxism be considered a clinical form or sequlae of painful orofacial-dystonia?

- Historically has been ambigious as to whether these are functional and/or organic disorders, leading to unequivocal findings
- Share the root cause of a disruption in the excitatory and inhibitory pathways of the trigeminal system
- Clinically, sort of; electrophysiologically, no

---
# Takeaways
- Duration of bruxism (not frequency) contributes to poorer quality of sleep
- May mimic tardive dystonia due to similar underlying pathways
- 


----
## More Practical Takeaways
- Association with Temporomandibular disorders
    + may explain morning, temporal headaches
- Probably refer to dental for splint or other work
- Referal to Sleep Medicine *may* be helpful, but this is a clinical diagnosis (PSG not necesarry!)
    + Treatment options are limited

## Fun Facts

In the Bible there are several references to "gnashing of teeth" in both the Old Testament,and the New Testament, where the phrase "wailing and gnashing of teeth" describes what an imaginary king believes is occurring in the darkness outside of his son's wedding venue.(Matthew 22:13)

A Chinese proverb has linked Bruxism with psychosocial factors. "If a boy clenches, he hates his family for not being prosperous; if a girl clenches, she hates her mother for not being dead."(男孩咬牙，恨家不起；女孩咬牙，恨妈不死。)
