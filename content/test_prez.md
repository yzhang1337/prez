## Definition

*‘la bruxomanie’ was first introduced by Marie
Pietkiewicz in 1907* 

"repetitive masticatory muscle activity that is characterized
by clenching or grinding of the teeth and/or by bracing or thrusting of the mandible,
which is specified as either sleep bruxism or awake bruxism..."

Two types:
- nocturnal vs awake 

----
## How often does it happen?

- in adult populations, frequency is between 5.9 - 49.0%
    - *from 1966 to 2002 there was an increase from 5 to 22% in university aged adults*
- Awake Bruxism, Female > male tendency 
- elderly population is relatively free of bruxism


----
## Who are the grinders?

- depression
- generalized anxiety
- high stress
- drug-induced

# Drug-Induced Bruxism

----
# Which Drugs?

-  **3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy, MDMA)**
- Cocaine
- amphetamines
- SSRI's/SNRI's
    1. Fluoxetine + Sertraline
    2. Venlafaxine
- L-DOPA

----
# Out in the world...

- "meth mouth"
- Sex, drugs & rock 'n' roll
    - "gurning"
- tooth decay

----
# Working hypothesis

Serotonin x Dopamine

----
# Dopamine
- balance of motor output in PFC by maintaning inhibitory tone
- DA activity in the PFC is modulated by inhibitory 5-HT neurons (mesocortical tract and ventral tegmental area)

----
# 5-HT
- decreases DA activity at PFC
- trigeminal motor neurons are activated by 5-HT (and NE)

----
# All together now...

- Raphe Nucleus (5-HT neurons)
- VTA
- Mesocortical DA Tract
- PFC
- Trigeminal Nerve
- Masticatory Muscles

# References

In the Bible there are several references to "gnashing of teeth" in both the Old Testament,[63] and the New Testament, where the phrase "wailing and gnashing of teeth" describes what an imaginary king believes is occurring in the darkness outside of his son's wedding venue.(Matthew 22:13[64])

A Chinese proverb has linked Bruxism with psychosocial factors. "If a boy clenches, he hates his family for not being prosperous; if a girl clenches, she hates her mother for not being dead."(男孩咬牙，恨家不起；女孩咬牙，恨妈不死。)[65]
